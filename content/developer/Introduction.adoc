== What is SuiteCRM?

The story of https://www.suitecrm.com[SuiteCRM] starts with SugarCRM.
SugarCRM was founded in 2004 and consisted of an open source version
(called Community Edition) and various paid versions. However
trouble started brewing when it appeared that SugarCRM would not be
releasing a Community Edition of SugarCRM 7 and would be providing
limited, if any, updates to the Community Edition.

Enter SuiteCRM. 

https://salesagility.com/[SalesAgility] forked SugarCRM Community Edition to create SuiteCRM
and added various open source plugins for improved
functionality.

== This guide

This guide is intended for developers who are familiar (or at least
acquainted) with using SuiteCRM but want to perform their own
customisations. SuiteCRM is a large and mature piece of software so it
is impractical for a guide to cover all aspects of the software. I’ve
tried to add the most important parts which should allow you to make the
changes you need in 99% of situations. There is a further resources
chapter at the end of this guide to help out in those 1% of cases. With
that being said if you feel there is anything important I have left out
(or worse, anything incorrect in the guide) please let me know. I can be
contacted at http://www.jsmackin.co.uk[JSMackin.co.uk].

== Reading this guide

Each chapter in this guide is intended to be self-contained so the reader
can jump to interesting chapters. Overlapping content is
usually indicated with links to the relevant chapters.

Some parts of this guide may refer to file paths or other parts of code
that can have a variable value, for example controller names contain the
module name or a file with an arbitrary name. In this case these will be
marked in the form `<TheModuleName>`, `<TheFileName>` or something else
suitable. In these cases you can substitute something appropriate (such
as `Accounts` or `MyNewFile`).

== Setting up SuiteCRM

[discrete]
==== Downloading and Installing

Visit the product's website to download the 
https://suitecrm.com/download/[SuiteCRM installer].

In the Administration guide you will find link:../../admin/installation-guide/downloading-installing/[Installation instructions].

[discrete]
==== GitHub

SuiteCRM is also available on http://github.com[GitHub] at
https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM[github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM].
Each SuiteCRM version is tagged so you can easily grab the version you
need.

== Initial Tweaks

After the initial install there are a few tweaks you may want to make on
an instance you are developing on. These changes should improve your
development flow and productivity as well as help identify issues if
they occur.

[discrete]
==== Developer Mode

SuiteCRM will cache various files that it processes, such as Smarty
templates. Developer mode will turn off some of the caching so that
changes to files will be seen immediately (though this isn’t always the
case - as is the case with
link:../extension-framework/[extensions]). This can be enabled
either through the config file or via the General settings page inside
admin.

[discrete]
==== Log Level

The default log level of SuiteCRM is `fatal`. This is a good default for
production instances but you may want to increase the log level to
`info` or `debug`. This will make the log output more verbose so, should
anything go wrong, you’ll have something to refer to. See the
link:../logging/[chapter on logging] for more
information.

[discrete]
==== Display errors

You’ll also want to turn off display errors. Unfortunately at the moment
SuiteCRM has various notices and warnings out of the box. With
`display_errors` on this can sometimes cause AJAX pages and the link to
break.

With this being said you should be checking the PHP error logs or
selectively enabling +
`display_errors` to ensure that the code you are creating is not
creating additional notices, warnings or errors.

==== XDebug

http://xdebug.org[XDebug] is a PHP extension which provides profiling
and debugging capabilities to PHP. This can massively improve developer
productivity by simplifying development and, particularly, tracking down
any issues. See the XDebug site for information on XDebug. link:../introduction[↩]
